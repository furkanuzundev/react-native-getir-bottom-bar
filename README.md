![Uygulama Ekran Görüntüsü](https://github.com/furkanuzundev/react-native-getir-bottom-bar/blob/main/getir.gif?raw=true)


I made this project for fun in my animation adventure with react-native!




## What did i use?


- Expo (44.0)
- TypeScript
- [React native reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- [React-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/5.x/getting-started)


## Try it!

clone project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furkanuzundev/react-native-getir-bottom-bar.git
```

install the packages

```bash
yarn install
```

start the package server

```bash
yarn start
```

When you start the expo server, you can scan QR code from your phone or ```press i``` for iOS or ```press a``` for Android to run project the devices on the same network.

Then enjoy 🥳
